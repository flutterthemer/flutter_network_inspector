## Getting started

Create a client for your network calls, which is an object of FNIClient.
Then use this client to do all network calls.
You can also use the network inspector UI to view all the info about the network calls.
The UI is fully compatible with your app's theme.

## Usage

```dart
 // Create a client for doing network calls.
 final client = FNICLient();
 // To enable logging of data to console.
 client.setEnableLogging(true);

 // Use the client for networking calls.
 final postResponse = await client.post(
    Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: '{"title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1}',
 );
```

To view the details of network calls, you can add the Flutter network inspector UI anywhere in your widget tree. 

```dart
 @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        elevation: 3,
        title: const Text('Flutter Network Inspector'),
      ),
      body: const FNIHome(), // show all network activity, use it with your navigator too.
    );
  }
```
